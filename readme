--- ATP Residue Prediction ---
by Bryan Andrews and Jing Hu

--- Set-up and Configuration---
Before running the program, you must make a directory in the pipeline folder
which holds the .fa files of which you wish to predict the ATP binding
residues (do no call the directory trainer).  Next you will have to update
the path to blast, the nr-database, disopred, and weka.  If you open the
pipeline.py file they will be at the top and clearly labeled.  These tools
must be set up correctly; see their readme files for set up intructions.

Note, the file trainer_zscores had to be split into 4 files in accordance
to GitHub's maximum file limit.  Please change to the Data directory and
run the following command:

cat trainer_zscores_* > trainer_zscores.txt; rm trainer_zscores_*

--- Running ---
The program has 7 parameters/options:

-d directory
This is the directory you created which holds the novel data to be processed
and is the only required parameter.

-n number of threads
This will allows for multithreading.  Note that if you wish for disopred to
use multithreading you must go into the disopred tool and adjust that
yourself. This is defaulted to 1.

-k k neighbors for KNN
This the number of nearest neighbors used in the first classifier. This is
defaulted to 65.

-a alpha value for KNN
This value is used to modify the significance of the values generated in the
first classifer. This is defaulted to 7.8.

-b run blast
This allows you to run or not run blast (takes 0 for don't run blast or 1 for
run blast). Only choose to not run blast if you already have the pssm-matrix
files from a previous run. The directory holding these files must be in the
pipeline folder. This is defaulted to 1.

-f feature selection
This is a string if booleans that are associated the features which you wish
to have turned on or off (0 specifies off and 1 specifies on). There are 14
featuresin total which in order are:
KNNprediction confidence score from the first classifer
Position      position of the residue in the protein sequence
Residue       alphanumeric representation of the residue
BULH740101    transfer free energy to surface
EISD840101    consensus normalized hydrophobicity
HOPT810101    hydrophilicity value 
RADA880108    mean polarity 
ZIMJ680104    isoelectric point 
MCMT640101    refractivity
BHAR880101    average flexibility indices 
CHOC750101    average volume of buried residue 
COSI940101    electron-ion interaction potential values
Entropy       entropy score of the residue
Disorder      disorder score of the residue
This is defaulted to 10010101101111 which is:
KNNprediction
BULH740101
RADA880108
MCMT640101
CHOC750101
COSI940101
Entropy
Disorder

-t threshold value
This specifies the threshold at which you want to classify a confidence score
as postive ATP binding or negative non-ATP binding for the second classfier.
This is defaulted to 0.5

The results will be written to the Results directory in .fa file format.
